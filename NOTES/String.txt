String is not a primitive.
String is a class from java.lang package.
String is nothing but a sequence of characters.

# Properties
1. Immutable (=>Security, thread-safety, caching in String Pool)
2. Strings stored in String Constant Pool (Same literal references the same object, since all strings are stored in String Constant Pool inside heap memory)
3. If Strings are created with new keyword, new memory allocation is forced in the heap memory. 

# String Constructors
1. String() => Creates empty string ("")
Ex: String s1 = new String();
2. String(String original) => Copies original string to another
Ex: String s1 = "Hello";
    String s2 = new String(s1); //s2 = Hello
3. String(char[] val) => Converts array of characters to a string
Ex: char[] val = {'a','b','c','d'};
    String s = new String(val); //s=abcd
4. String(char[] val, int offset, int count) => From the specified offset value, the count number of further appearing characters are taken
Ex: char[] val = {'a','b','c','d','e','f'};
    String s = new String(val, 1, 3); //s=bcd
5. String[byte[] val] => Converts array of byte values(to their corresponding values) 
6. String(char[] val, int offset, int count) => From the specified offset value, the count number of further appearing characters are taken
Ex: char[] val = {'a','b','c','d','e','f'};
    String s = new String(val, 1, 3); //s=bcd
